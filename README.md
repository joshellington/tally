# Tally

A lofi "real-time" visitor counter for webpages and the like.

## Backend

Setup for Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda. Only requires a single S3 bucket.

## Browser

Current working demo is in `browser/`. To start the demo: `npm run dev`

Recommend firing up [localtunnel.me](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) or something similar for easy testing across devices.

*Note, currently pointed to my personal Lambda stack*

## TODO

- Setup tooling for frontend library
- Lots more testing across device types/OS versions
